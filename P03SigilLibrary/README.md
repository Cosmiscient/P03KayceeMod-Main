# P03 Kaycee's Mod - Sigilarium

All of the custom sigils you love from [P03 in Kaycee's Mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/inscryption/p/Infiniscryption/P03_In_Kaycees_Mod/) are now available on their own. You can now use these sigils, as well as some simple sigil templates, in your own mods without having to have the entirety of the P03 Mod as a dependency.

Full documentation of everything in this mod can be found at the [Botopia Developer's Hub](https://github.com/Cosmiscient/P03KayceeMod-Main/wiki/Sigils)
