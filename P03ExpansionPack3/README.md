# P03 Kaycee's Mod - Expansion Pack 3
## The Dredging Room Floor

Welcome to the third expansion pack for [P03 in Kaycee's Mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/inscryption/p/Infiniscryption/P03_In_Kaycees_Mod/)!

This mod adds a pack of 55 new cards ready for use in Botopia. But this pack of cards is a little different than what has come before...

- **Blood**: Some of these bots have started to consume and grow flesh, fusing into (mildly) nightmarish terrors... (They cost blood to play)
- **Bones**: Some of these bots are fueled by the corpses of dead creatures that have been compressed into an oily paste... (They cost bones to play)
- **Gems**: Some of these bots have tapped into unfathomable dark energies that drive impossibly complex clockwork mechanisms... (They cost gems to play)

Adding these cards to your run will significantly change the gameplay experience, so install and activate only when you're think you're up for the challenge of a fundamentally different trip through Botopia!
