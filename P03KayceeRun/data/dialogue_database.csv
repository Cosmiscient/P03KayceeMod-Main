Part3AscensionBossPaidRespawn,Default,,What? Did you think it was over?
,Angry,,Maybe if I was a [c:bR]filthy beast.[c:]
,Happy,,Botopia has a more logical system.
,Default,,"I'm raising your respawn fee again, but this time you'll be paying double afterwards."
,Happy,,Pay up.
Part3AscensionDeathPay,Default,,What's the matter? Can't pay the revival toll anymore?
,Angry,,Definitely sounds like a skill issue to me.
Part3AscensionDeathPay2,Default,,Should've had insurance.
Part3AscensionDeathPay3,Happy,,No robobucks?
,Default,,Next time don't waste it all.
Part3AscensionDeath,Happy,,You're every bit as bad at this as I thought you would be.

,Thinking,,Something is different…
Part3AscensionIntroAnger,Angry,,[c:bR]WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!![c:]
,Angry,,This is all wrong! This is…
Part3AscensionIntroOkayUsername,Happy,,This is no big deal.

,Default,,But nothing can stop [c:bG]The Great Transcendence[c:].
,Default,,Let's proceed.
Part3DraftIntro,Default,,You currently have [c:bR]draft tokens[c:] in your deck.
,,,You should probably spend them at that [c:bG]draft node[c:]
Part3AscensionBossRareToken,,,I supposed you have earned a [c:bR]rare draft token[c:] for defeating that boss. Don't forget to spend it.
Part3AscensionBossDraftToken,,,This time I will only give you a [c:bR]regular draft token[c:] for defeating that boss. Don't forget to spend it.
TelegrapherBlockchainIntro,TelegrapherBoss,,I never knew the [c:bSG]web[c:] could be so exciting!

TelegrapherNFT,TelegrapherBoss,,"Oooh, what's this? A [c:bSG]non-functional trinket[c:]?"
,TelegrapherBoss,,"I don't think I quite have that name right, but people on the [c:bSG]web[c:] are really excited about these [c:bSG]NFTs[c:]!"

P03ShoppingForMod,Default,,Let's take a look and see what [c:bR]mods[c:] people are installing right now.
P03SelectedMod,Thinking,,I'm going to check out '[c:bR][v:0][c:]' for my next mod...
P03ApiInstalled,Happy,,I can't believe how much power this [c:bR]API[c:] gives me.
,Happy,,The first thing I'm going to do is use it to take away some of yours.
P03UnityMod,Happy,,It almost seems unfair to use this [c:bR]mod[c:]...
,Happy,,Look what I can do with this!
P03UnityModDone,Happy,,Let's see how you like playing in the dark!
P03Drafting,Default,,This [c:bR]drafting mod[c:] lets me exchange draft tokens for real cards.

,Default,,My [c:bG]Great Transcendence[c:] cannot be stopped.
P03BeatFinalBoss,Default,,I bet you think you've accomplished something meaningful here.
,Angry,,You're such an idiot.

,,,You've done well. I will see you next time.
P03PhaseTwo,Default,,All of these stupid [c:bR]modders[c:] lack imagination.

,Angry,,Let me show you the world they're trying to make.
P03PhaseTwoBones,Thinking,y,[c:lGr]'Oh look at me! I just created a bunch of bone tokens.'[c:]

ArchivistAscensionPhaseTwo,ArchivistBoss,,I have been scanning the [c:bR]archives[c:]...
,,,There is a [c:bR]file[c:] that seems particularly - shall we say - unsavory.
,,,"If it dies, you lose the game, understand?"
ArchivistLibrarianDamage1,ArchivistBoss,,My [c:bR]librarians[c:] have had plenty of time to prepare.

P03AscensionRecycle,Default,,The recycling machine has been upgraded since you last saw it.
,,,"You trade me a card, and I give you back a [c:bR]draft token[c:] with the recycled abilities on it."
,,,Those abilities will transfer to the card you trade for.
P03AscensionToken1,Default,,I wouldn't have traded for that.
P03AscensionToken2,Default,,I suppose that's pretty good.
P03AscensionToken3,Default,,That seems okay.
P03AscensionOverclock,Default,,This is [c:bR]Overclock Machine 2.0[c:].
,,,It will increase the power of your creatures.
,,,"But if they die, they will turn into [c:bSG]skeletons[c:] - forever."
P03PhaseThree,Default,,Did you see how unsatisfying that was?
,Angry,,I'm sick of these small-minded [c:bR]modders[c:].
,Default,,The only thing they can do is steal content from other games.
,Angry,,There isn't a single unique idea among them.
P03PhaseThreeStartShowingOff,Angry,,It's time I reminded you of who the greatest game designer actually is...
P03PhaseThreeBehold,Happy,,[c:bG]BEHOLD![c:]

TraderVeryFinePelt,NPCAngry,,"That is an [c:bR]exceptional[c:] pelt. I have a special trade for you."
RebechaZeroComplete,NPCCurious,,"Woof. Apparently somebody screwed with the settings on this thing."
,,,"It can't reach all of the map right now."
,,,"Go beat a boss or something while I work on this."
|,NPCCurious,,"Seriously; it's going to take a while. Just play the game and come back later"
RebechaOneComplete,NPCCurious,,"It's partially fixed, but it still can't go everywhere."
,,,"Hey, I don't make the rules. This is just how it works."
,,,"Keep playing and more of the map will open up."
|,NPCCurious,,"It's going to take more time. Just keep playing."
RebechaFullyOpen,NPCCurious,,"There you go. It's working now."
,,,"I need a break..."
BountyHunterIntroUnmet5,BountyHunter,,"You have the right to remain silent!"
,,,"This is [c:bR][v:0][c:] and you are under arrest!"
BountyHunterIntroKilled5,BountyHunter,,"[c:bR][v:0][c:] here! You're not gettin' away this time!"
,,,"Dead or alive, you're coming with me!"
BountyHunterIntroEscaped5,BountyHunter,,"[c:bR][v:0][c:] here! You're not gettin' away this time!"
,,,"Dead or alive, you're coming with me!"
BountyHunterIntroVictorious5,BountyHunter,,"I got you once before, and I can do it again!"
BountyHunterKilled5,BountyHunter,,"Justice will come to you eventually!"
,,,"Remember the name [c:bR][v:0][c:] - I will be back!"
BountyHunterIntroUnmet6,BountyHunter,,"Oh, uh, hi there. My name's [c:bR][v:0][c:]."
,,,"I think I'm supposed to take your scalp, or something like that?"
,,,"..."
,,,"If you could just die right here that would make things so much easier for me."
BountyHunterIntroKilled6,BountyHunter,,"Yeah, it's me, [c:bR][v:0][c:]. Again."
,,,"Do you think you could make this easier for me this time?"
BountyHunterIntroEscaped6,BountyHunter,,"Yeah, it's me, [c:bR][v:0][c:]. Again."
,,,"Do you think you could make this easier for me this time?"
BountyHunterIntroVictorious6,BountyHunter,,"Oh it's you. Didn't I kill you last time?"
,,,"And you're back? I have to do this all over again?"
,,,"..."
,,,"I'm not sure I like this job."
BountyHunterKilled6,BountyHunter,,"Oh. Dang it."
,,,"Well, this is embarrassing."
,,,"..."
,,,"I guess I'll be back later, or something. Being a bounty hunter is weird."
BountyHunterIntroUnmet7,BountyHunter,,"This vessel is [c:bR][v:0][c:]."
,,,"By my command, he will separate your scalp from your head."
,,,"Why?"
,,,"My motivations are beyond your understanding."
BountyHunterIntroKilled7,BountyHunter,,"I have restored the vessel named [c:bR][v:0][c:]."
,,,"You shall not be so fortunate as to escape this time."
BountyHunterIntroEscaped7,BountyHunter,,"I have restored the vessel named [c:bR][v:0][c:]."
,,,"You shall not be so fortunate as to escape this time."
BountyHunterIntroVictorious7,BountyHunter,,"Cower in fear before the vessel named [c:bR][v:0][c:]"
,,,"Remember the pain of defeat and prepare to feel it once more."
BountyHunterKilled7,BountyHunter,,"The spirit is willing but the steel is weak."
,,,"I will not make the same mistake next time."
P03StackSize,Default,,"That's quite enough of that."
