Are you tired of Leshy? Mildly disturbed by Grimora? Intimidated by Magnificus? This is the mod for you! 

Installing this mod will give you the option to play against either Leshy or P03 when you start a new run. Selecting Leshy will give you the standard game you're used to, but selecting P03 will send you to the land of Botopia, where you will draft robotic cards (including all new cards created just for this mod), explore procedurally generated maps, fight off bounty hunters, and purchase upgrades with your hard-earned robobucks. And at the end of it all, P03 is waiting for you in an all-new boss fight.

## I'm new here - how do I install this?

[Follow this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASOJ4idMRxk) to an easy-to-follow guide for how to get started with Inscryption modding.

## Whats new in version 5.0?

- **Final Boss Challenge**: The mod now has a final boss challenge that unlocks once you reach the final challenge level. Activating this challenge will cause a new final boss to appear at the very end of the game.
- **Better Map Generation**: The procedurally generated map has been significantly upgraded with more varied terrain.
- **Customizable Player Figurine**: A secret map room has been added that allows you to change your player figurine.
- **Talking Cards**: Four talking cards have been added to the mod. They appear as rewards for new quests that are part of the quest pool.

## What's new in version 4.0?

- **Expansion Pack 2**: With 50 new cards and all-new mechanics!
- **Achievements**: That happy little ding and extra rush of dopamine when you do something extra special.
- **Stickers**: Unlockable cosmetics to customize your cards and show off your swag. If you want some *extra* swag, I **highly** recommend installing the [High Res Mod](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/overfall/InscryptionHighRes/) to really make those stickers pop. 
- **New Items**: The UFO abducts a card from the board and puts it in your hand. And the Laser Rifle upgrades any card by giving it the Sniper ability for the rest of the battle.
- **Faster Navigation**: You can now fast travel to any room that you've visited before by clicking it on the minimap. And rather than clicking arrows, you can also travel through the map by using the IJKL keys on your keyboard like arrow keys.

## How does this mod work?

When you install this mod, you will see two 'new run' options on the opening screen for Kaycee's Mod. You can either start a New Leshy Run (the default KCM experience) or a new P03 run (this mod's experience).

P03 runs differ from Leshy runs in a few significant ways:

1) You have more choice over how the maps play out:
    - You can fight through the four zones in any order you choose. 
    - You are not forced to use any map nodes that you don't want to. (Pro tip: you still need to add cards to your deck - matches last longer than you might be used to).
2) Most of your choices are based on how you manage your currency. You will find some currency on the map, and you earn more of it by 'overkilling' P03 during battles, by killing bounty hunters, and by completing quests given to you by NPCs on the map. (Pro tip: you should deliberately overkill as much as possible if you want to build a strong of a deck as possible). Every upgrade you select will cost you robobucks. The only thing that's free is adding new cards to your deck.

There are also some changes from the way P03's gameplay worked the first time through:

1) Bosses have been updated. G0lly and the Archivist are the most significantly different; both of them have completely reworked second phases. 
2) There is a final boss fight against P03. He has...some thoughts about what you're doing.
3) Some events work differently (see below).
4) There are now NPCs that will give you quests with rewards for your run.
5) And there...might be some other hidden secrets as well.

The runs are still similar to Leshy in significant ways:

1) There are a number of starter decks that you can pick from to help guide your selections through the rest of the game.
2) Starter decks have four cards and one "draft token," which allows you to choose a card from a draft node event on the first map screen.
3) You must complete four battles against enemies before facing the boss. Once you beat the boss, you're done with that zone and can't go back.

### Events

Some events play the same in this mod as they did the first time you played through Botopia. However, some are different. Here's what you need to know before spending your robobucks on an event:

- **Build-a-Card**: This is mostly the same as before, but the ability pool has been significantly modified. You can also enter whatever name you want for the card, a power you should *definitely* use wisely.
- **Gemify Cards**: This behaves the same as before.
- **Items**: You can buy an item like you would in Act 1. However, you can only get one item from each shop.
- **Overclock**: This is significantly different. As before, the overclocked card gets +1 attack. However, when an overclocked card dies, it is not completely removed from your deck. It is replaced with an Exeskeleton with the same set of abilities as the original card. So if you overclock a Sniper and it dies, you will get an Exeskeleton with the Sniper sigil.
- **Recycle**: Instead of getting robobucks back for your recycled card, you get a draft token. Normal cards get you a standard Token, with all of the card's abilities imprinted on the token. Those abilities will transfer to the card you draft with it. Rare cards get you a Rare token, which can be exchanged for another rare card.
- **Transformer**: There are now more options to select for the beast transformations, some which comes with additional bonuses and drawbacks. Pay close attention to the energy cost and health associated!

### NPCs

You will encounter NPCs scattered throughout each map. They will give you optional side quests that will grant special rewards upon completion. Often these rewards will be extra money, but sometimes a side quest might lead to something a bit more exciting.

### Achievements and Stickers

Version 4.0 comes with support for achievements! You can view the list of achievements under the "Unlocks" screen in Kaycee's Mod. Each achievement you unlock will also unlock a cosmetic sticker that you can apply to your cards during the run to show off just how good you are at this game (or just because you think SteamBot looks really dapper with a top hat). Stickers can be applied to your cards at any time on the deck review screen (press "W" while at the main map).

### Speedrunning - Quality of Life Improvements

Version 4.0 adds some significant quality of life improvements to help you play the mod a little bit faster. You can navigate the map using the IJKL keys on your keyboard (think WASD movement, but with different keys because the game already uses WASD for other purposes). You an also click any room on the minimap that you've already visited to travel directly back there, saving you the time required to walk back across the map.
